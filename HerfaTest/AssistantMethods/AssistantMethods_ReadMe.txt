Assistant Methods Folder Overview:
This folder contains the helper/assistant methods used in the test cases. To achieve modularity and separation of concerns, we have divided these methods into multiple classes. Each class is responsible for a specific feature and includes helper methods related to that feature.

Example: The Login_AssistantMethods class contains:

The FillLoginForm method, which is not a test method itself but serves as an assistant method. This method can be used within the main test methods to fill out the login form.
